# Transformer-architecture-step-by-step

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer architecture using PyTorch. Transformers are powerful models that have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). They are known for their ability to handle long-range dependencies in data and have been the backbone of many state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and T5.

## Features

- Full implementation of the Transformer architecture.
- Easy-to-understand code with comments.
- Configurable parameters for customization.
